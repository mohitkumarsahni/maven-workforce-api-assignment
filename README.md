Integer As A Service : REST API Assignment by Maven Workforce.

### Incrementing Integers As A Service

**User Story**

As a developer, I need a way to get integers that automatically increment so that I can generate identifiers from within my code. I am in a hurry and would like to call a REST endpoint that returns the next available integer so that I can get on with building my feature. Why I need to generate identifiers using sequential integers is not important ;) Suffice it to say that this challenge is based on a real-world scenario.

**Your Task**

Develop a REST service that:

1. Allows me to register as a user. At a minimum, this should be a REST endpoint that accepts an email address and a password and returns an API key. **[DONE]**
2. Returns the next integer in my sequence when called. For example, if my current integer is 12, the service should return 13 when it is called. The endpoint should be secured by an API key. I should not have to provide the previous value of the integer for this to work. Fetching the next integer should cause my current integer to increment by 1 on the server so that if I call the endpoint again, I get the next integer in the sequence. **[DONE]**
3. Allows me to fetch my current integer. For example, if my current integer is 12, the service should return 12. The endpoint should be secured by API key. **[DONE]**
4. Allows me to reset my integer to an arbitrary, non-negative value. For example, my integer may be currently 1005. I would like to reset it to 1000. The endpoint should be secured by API key. **[DONE]**

**Stretch Goals**

1. Build a UI for the service, especially the account creation functionality. a. Take it a step further and build the UI as a single page app that consumes your API. **[In Progress]**
2. Allow sign up using OAuth a. Github, Facebook, Google â€” anything that supports it! **[In Progress]**
3. Deploy your API and include the link in your README so we can try it out without having to run it. **[In Progress]**

### How To Run:
**Requirements:**
1. Java 1.8
2. Maven Build Tool.
3. MongoDB 4.2 or above. (You can use Atlas Mongo free tier instance.)

**Steps:**
1. Change the value of MongoDB URI parameter in the "application.properties" file. Name of the parameter is : "spring.data.mongodb.uri"
   Also can change the "server.port" value as per requirement.
2. Clone the repository.
3. "cd" into the cloned repository. And run "mvn clean install"
4. The JAR will be created into the target folder.
5. Run "java -jar <JAR-File-Path>"

It will start the Server on the provided port in the application properties.

### Data Models:

**1. Success Response :**

   ```
      {
          "response": "SUCCESS",
          "data": <data-object>,
          "timestamp": <timestamp-value>
      }
   ```

**2. Error Response :**
   ```
      {
          "response": "ERROR",
          "error": {
              "errorMessage": <detailed-message>,
              "errorCode": <message-code>
          },
          "timestamp": <timestamp-value>
      }
   ```

         }
      ```
   4. Success Response:
      ```
      ```
   5. Error Response:
      ```
      ```
